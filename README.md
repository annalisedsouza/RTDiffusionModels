<b> Using RT diffusion models in R to calculate SAT in 2CRT data <b/> 

This project uses the EZ diffusion model to analyze reaction time (RT) distributions for a two-choice reaction time (2CRT) experiment. 
The goal was to model speed-accuracy tradeoffs (SAT) in RT data using a diffusion model.

Details of the files for this project
1. "DiffusionModelsfor SAT.R" contains steps for creating simulated data and modelling RT distributions
2. "EZdiffusion.R" contains the EZ diffusion model script created by Wagenmakers, van der Maas, and Grasman (2007)
3. "DSouza 2019.docx" contains a methodology paper discussing the project
